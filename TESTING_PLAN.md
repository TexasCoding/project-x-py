## Testing Guidelines

### 1. Test Structure
- Use pytest framework
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- All error cases must be tested
- Edge cases must be covered

### 3. Performance Criteria
- Order submission < 100ms
- Market data updates < 50ms
- Position calculations < 10ms
- Memory usage < 500MB under normal load

### 4. Security Testing
- Authentication token handling
- Secure credential storage
- API key protection
- Session management

## Known Issues

### SignalR Mocking Issue
- **Problem**: Cannot mock `signalrcore.HubConnectionBuilder`
- **Impact**: Real-time client tests cannot be executed
- **Workaround**: Consider alternative mocking strategies or integration tests
- **Status**: Under investigation

### Test Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Mock API endpoints
- Test credentials
- Isolated test environment

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Begin Phase 2 order management tests
2. **Short-term**: Resolve SignalR mocking issue
3. **Medium-term**: Complete Phase 3 real-time tests
4. **Long-term**: Implement performance and stress testing

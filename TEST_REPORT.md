### ‚úÖ Order Status Tracking (15/15 passing)
- Get order by ID
- Check if order is filled
- Search open orders with filtering
- Order status progression tracking
- Order rejection and cancellation tracking
- Order statistics tracking
- Real-time cache integration
- Error handling in order search
- Event callback registration and triggering
- Multiple callback support
- Callback error isolation
- **Coverage Impact**: Order lifecycle tracking validated

### üî≤ Position Management Integration (Not Started)
- Position creation from fills
- Position updates
- P&L calculations

### üî≤ Risk Management Features (Not Started)
- Position size limits
- Daily loss limits
- Margin requirements

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Authentication System**: Robust with proper token management and multi-account support
2. **Order Management**: Comprehensive order lifecycle handling with proper error cases
3. **Price Alignment**: Automatic tick size alignment prevents invalid price errors
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all components

### Issues Discovered & Fixed
1. **Lazy Authentication**: Tests initially failed due to misunderstanding of lazy auth pattern
2. **Polars DataFrame**: Fixed timestamp formatting issues in historical data tests
3. **Model Imports**: Corrected enum usage (models use integers, not enums)
4. **Order Manager**: Fixed attribute access patterns

### Blockers
1. **SignalR Mocking**: Cannot test real-time functionality due to missing attribute in signalrcore package
   - **Impact**: 12 tests cannot be executed
   - **Recommendation**: Investigate alternative mocking strategies or integration testing

## Code Coverage Analysis

### High Coverage Areas
- `models.py`: 100% coverage
- `exceptions.py`: 79% coverage
- `order_manager.py`: 57% coverage (up from baseline)

### Low Coverage Areas
- `client.py`: 8% coverage (needs more test scenarios)
- `orderbook.py`: 7% coverage (not yet tested)
- `position_manager.py`: 13% coverage (not yet tested)
- `realtime.py`: 11% coverage (blocked by SignalR issue)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Continue Phase 2**: Complete order status tracking and position management tests
2. **SignalR Workaround**: Investigate alternative approaches for real-time testing
3. **Client Coverage**: Add more test scenarios for client.py methods

### Future Improvements
1. **Integration Tests**: Add end-to-end tests with mock server
2. **Performance Tests**: Implement load testing for order submission
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation based on test findings

## Test Execution Command

To run all tests with coverage:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/project_x_py --cov-report=term-missing
```

To run specific test suites:
```bash
# Authentication tests only
python -m pytest tests/test_client_auth.py -v

# Order management tests
python -m pytest tests/test_order_creation.py tests/test_order_modification.py -v
```

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2 Completion**: Continue with order status tracking tests
2. **Phase 3 Planning**: Prepare for real-time feature testing (pending SignalR fix)
3. **Coverage Improvement**: Target low-coverage modules with additional tests
4. **Documentation**: Update testing plan based on findings
